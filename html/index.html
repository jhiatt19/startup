                <h2>What the heck is this website all about?</h2>
                <p>This website is going to have pages that I have feel will be helpful to have in one place. Gone are the days of having 45 tabs open and crashing my computer. I will attempt to have all the necessary tools/pages all in one place.</p>

                <h3>This will be a place holder for my PDF extractor</h3>
                <p>I really have a difficult time reading. If I need to read for longer than 5 minutes at one time, I tend to zone out and am unable to focus as well. However, listening to longer articles or books is no big deal. So I created a python script to extract text out of a pdf so that I can have an AI read it to me.</p>

                <h3>Task Prioritizer</h3>
                <p>Another thing that I struggle with is determining what tasks to do at different times. Sometimes I spend more time coming up with a plan on when I will do all my tasks than actually doing the task. In this section I hope to create an algorithm to place tasks into my calendar based on priority and estimated time to complete task.</p>
